Cloud-Native GKE Application: Welcome to the Cloud-Native GKE Application repository. This professional project showcases the implementation of a cloud-native application using Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP). Through this repository, we explore the world of containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes, creating a robust cloud-native solution.

---

## Overview

Dive into the realm of cloud-native applications with the Cloud-Native GKE Application repository. This project exemplifies the use of containerization, CI/CD pipelines, and Kubernetes to develop and deploy a powerful microservices-based application on GCP's GKE. From microservices communication to persistent data storage, this project covers it all.

### Learning Outcomes

This repository embodies the mastery of the following concepts:

- Containerization using Docker
- Building CI/CD pipelines with GCP tools
- Harnessing the power of Kubernetes, both through the GCP console and Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform
- Deploying applications on GKE clusters using CI/CD pipelines
- Configuring and utilizing persistent volumes in GKE
- Effective usage of Kubernetes tools like kubectl for container management and cluster diagnosis
- Understanding application update strategies and version control in GKE

### Key Requirements

1. **Microservices Development:** Develop two microservices in your preferred programming language. These services should be designed to interact with each other, showcasing a seamless integration.

2. **CI/CD Pipeline:** Create a robust CI/CD pipeline using GCP tools such as Cloud Source Repository and Cloud Build. The pipeline should enable automated deployments to the GKE cluster whenever new code commits are made.

3. **Persistent Volume:** Configure a persistent volume in your GKE cluster, accessible to both microservices. Your application must be able to read from and write to this volume.

4. **GKE Cluster Setup:** Create a GKE cluster using Terraform. The configuration should align with the specifications outlined in the assignment.

5. **Exposing Services:** The deployment yaml file should not only deploy your microservices but also expose the services to the internet through Load Balancers Service.

6. **Internal Communication between PODS:** Allow internal communication between different microservices through ClusterIP Service.

### Repository Contents

This repository includes:

- Microservices source code
- Configuration files for the CI/CD pipeline using Cloud Build
- Terraform script for creating the GKE cluster
- Deployment yaml file for deploying microservices and exposing services, internal communication and attaching persistent volumes and persistent volume claim to the pods.
- Detailed documentation outlining the project's architecture, design principles, and instructions for setup and execution
